ALGORITHM 
Start the program
Initialize variables battery = 100, success = 0, delay = 0, fail = 0
Seed random number generator using current time
Display starting message and battery level
Set locations A, B, and C
For each location A B and C
Call function deliver for the current location
Inside deliver
Display which location delivery is starting
Call function getWeather to get weather condition
Condition weather is Rainy if yes the print delivery delayed increase delay by 1 and return to main
Condition weather is Rainy if  no then go to next step
Condition weather is Windy and battery < 40 ig yes then print windy and battery low recharge battery by 10 but not more than 100
Condition weather is Windy and battery < 40 if no theb continue
Call function checkObstacle to check for obstacle
Condition obstacle detected if yes then output or print rerouting and reduce battery by 15
Condition obstacle detected  if no then print no obstacle
Reduce battery by 10 for delivery
Condition battery ≤ 0 if yes theb print battery depleted delivery failed increase fail by 1 set battery = 0 return to main
Condition battery ≤ 0 → no → print delivery successful show battery level increase success by 1
After all deliveries call function summary
Display total successful delayed and failed deliveries and final battery level
End program
